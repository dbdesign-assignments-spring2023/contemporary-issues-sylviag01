# Data transparency in today's business
In this document, I discuss two articles on data transparency. Since today more data are collected from consumers and are being used for commercial purposes, data transparency becomes a focused problem related to data security and data privacy issues. I will present and discuss two different views on this important matter below.

## Article 1
In [Data Transparency In The Age Of Privacy Protection](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/03/25/data-transparency-in-the-age-of-privacy-protection/?sh=1ff07dd446b2) written by Steve Sirich, the author stated several ways to approach data transparency for business nowadays. From my point of view, for better exploitation of the data, it is true to let us customers know what kinds of data are being used for what purpose. Customers should have the right to be informed. Otherwise, I think I will be hesitant to share my data because of the uncertainties in its usage. 

Because collecting data are so important for companies in different industries today, I believe ensuring data transparency will be critical. People have so many concerns about data privacy issues, and only if they know clearly about the data transparency rule of one company, they will then be willing to share their information, and thus benefit the company itself.


## Article 2
However, thinking from the companies' perspectives, there is more to consider rather than only focusing on the privacy issue raised by customers. Brent Dykes' [Five Reasons Data Transparency Isn't Working In Your Organization (Yet)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2017/11/30/five-reasons-data-transparency-isnt-working-in-your-organization-yet/) has pointed out the people-based obstacles during the implementation of data transparency. For people own purpose like preserve their position or to show better performance, they manipulate the data and impede the fulfillment of data transparency.

In addition to that, I also think that sharing those data and the according purpose may be harmful to the company in a very competitive environment. Because other companies will also realize that those pieces of information are important and start to collect similar data. This reduced the leading role of some companies and they might refuse to be transparent with data and show how they operate with that. I think companies really need to find a balance in how to satisfy their customers for future development while not doing harm to their own by losing opportunities in their industry.
